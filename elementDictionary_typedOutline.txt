The goal of this program is to take in something about an element, and it will return all the information the user does not have.
The idea comes from my time in a chemistry lab. I got fed up with looking everything up, and really wished for a quick easy tool to let me convert things.
There are a number of ways to identify an element, but I will be going of off the symbol, the name, the atomic mass, and the atomic number.

i will need 3 labels, but i will have 5. What info the user has, and the 4 items from the search result.

the buttons which i need 3 of will be find(to find with entered info), add another(which should open a new window to search another element with), and clear(which will empty all the fields to allow another search.)

an additional exit button to close it all out.

i will make a separate dictionary to store all the info for the elements

the main module will search the dictionary for matching elements in its listed value. Should use if else loops to switch through the matches.

other modules will clear the fields, or add a new window to search.
